# JustJava

## This project is about combining various ideas and skills:
* Adding button code to app

* Updating views

* Properly scoping variables

* Finding views by their ID

#### Utilized: ConstraintLayout 2.0.0 [an Android Jetpack library]
* Which allows you to create large and complex layouts with a flat view hierarchy (no nested view groups).

# JustJava

## This project is about combining various ideas and skills:
* An app that lets users place order for Coffee.
* Add an intent to open the email app and populate with customers order.
* Create the basic structure of a single-screen app by
placing layouts on a page and integrating images, buttons,
and text.
* Group layouts to allow for more creativity and
variation in your design.

#### Utilized: ConstraintLayout 2.0.0 [an Android Jetpack library]
* Which allows you to create large and complex layouts with a flat view hierarchy (no nested view groups).
